# Project Overview

## Goal

Rapid development of web prototypes for a financial services institution with common components and consistent styling across all prototypes.

## Core Principles

- **Speed over perfection** - Deliver working prototypes quickly
- **Visual consistency** - All prototypes share styling and components
- **Organic growth** - Shared systems expand based on actual needs
- **One source of truth** - Components and styles defined once, used everywhere

## Process Rules

Process rules are enforced through the agent architecture:
- Workflow ordering and agent responsibilities are managed by the orchestrator
- Document creation, duplication checks, and quality controls are built into each agent
- User approval prompts occur at defined workflow stages
- Server must be started manually by the user (never automatically by agents)

## Reference Documents

1. **Technical Requirements**: See [2-requirements.md](2-requirements.md)
2. **CSS Implementation**: See [design-system/css-guidelines.md](../design-system/css-guidelines.md)
