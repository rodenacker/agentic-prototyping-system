# Project Overview

## Goal

Rapid development of web prototypes for a financial services institution with common components and consistent styling across all prototypes.

## Core Principles

- **Speed over perfection** - Deliver working prototypes quickly
- **Visual consistency** - All prototypes share styling and components
- **Organic growth** - Shared systems expand based on actual needs
- **One source of truth** - Components and styles defined once, used everywhere

## Rules

- **Critical:** Strictly follow these rules throughout the process.
- Strictly follow the workflow steps.
- Only create documents defined in the workflow.
- Don't duplicate information across documents. Refer to existing documents instead.
- Ask clarification questions when needed.
- Prompt user for review/approval at defined steps.
- Only ever prompt the user to start the server manually. Don't attempt to start the server automatically.
